# Edit the Docs

This documentation website is made with [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs), please see more details and usages in [official documentations](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs). 

Also, thanks to [Professor Jon E. Froehlich](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/member/jonfroehlich/) and the [Makeability Lab](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/)'s awesome `custom.css` for customizing the [usetocbot](https://tscanlin.github.io/tocbot/) and custom_layouts which really save my day. 

Below is some of my usages to customize the documentations. Hope you can find something useful.
